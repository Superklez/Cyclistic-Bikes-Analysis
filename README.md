# Cyclistic Bikes Analysis
## A capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate
This case study is done as part of the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) in [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org). In this case study (or capstone project), the task is to help a fictional company, Cyclistic, make a key business decision. Specifically, the company launched a bike-sharing offering in 2016, where they offer a variety of options to riders, including single-day passes, full-day passes and annual memberships to all their bikes. Since launch, the company noticed that annual memberships account for the most profits. Thus, the company wants to maximize annual memberships. To do this, the company will come up with design marketing strategies aimed at converting causal riders (those who opt for single-day passes or full-day passes) into annual members. The purpose of this analysis is to help understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.

**Business task: Understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently in order to convert casual riders into annual members and maximize the number of annual memberships.**
